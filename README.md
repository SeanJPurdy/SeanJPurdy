SEO Writer | Turning Keywords Into Traffic, Rankings & Leads 


Most blogs don’t fail because of bad writing, they fail because they ignore search intent. I help brands grow organic traffic with SEO blog posts that rank on Google and convert readers into leads.

Who I Am:

I’m an SEO content writer and strategist with 3+ years of experience publishing 130+ long-form articles built around keyword research + user intent. My content has earned #1 rankings on Google (for competitive lifestyle and travel terms like “Wild Swimming in Montenegro”) and has driven 200% organic traffic growth for niche sites in under 6 months.

Here’s what I can do for you:

✔ Write SEO blog posts (1,000–3,000 words) built around search intent & keyword research
✔ Build content strategies and clusters that drive long-term rankings
✔ Add copywriting hooks, CTAs, and formatting so your content converts
✔ Repurpose blog content into social snippets and short-form assets

Results I’ve Delivered:

#1 Google rankings in competitive niches

200% traffic growth in 6 months from niche cluster builds

135+ published articles across high-value SEO topics

Content calendars that improve engagement, dwell time, and authority

Why Work With Me:

I don’t churn out generic “ChatGPT-style” blogs. Every piece I create is tailored to search intent + audience needs, designed to rank, build topical authority, and convert readers into leads or customers.
